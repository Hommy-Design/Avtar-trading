Return and Refund Policy

Upon receipt of your returned item, we shall conduct an inspection and inform you that we have received the item. Subsequent to the inspection, you will be notified regarding the status of your refund.

Should your return meet our criteria, we will proceed to issue a refund to your original payment method.

The refund process may take approximately 5-7 working days, subject to the policies of your banking institution.

In instances where a discrepancy is identified in the delivered item compared to the ordered item, we urge you to contact our customer service to address the issue. Our commitment is to ensure the delivery of the correct order. Refunds will be considered only in cases where there is a non-availability of the ordered product. Under such circumstances, our Customer Care representative will engage with you to review your order.

For a return to be processed, the item must be in its unused state and in the same condition as it was received. The item must also be returned in its original packaging. If the items are damaged beyond resale, we regret to inform that refunds cannot be processed.

Our representative will collect the incorrect order from your premises. Once we receive the incorrect shipment, we will take immediate steps to dispatch the correct order. We kindly request your patience and allow us 3-5 working days to rectify the error.
